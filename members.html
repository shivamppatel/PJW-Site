								<p>Usually, the "AV Club" refers to the "Audio/Visual Club", but at the University of Texas at Austin it takes on a greater significance: the "Adil Virani Club". Membership includes inferior rival dancers frustrated that Adil's improv moves are better than their most rigorously choreo'd sets; puzzled scientists hell-bent on discovering the secrets to how Adil became human equivalent of a high-octane Ferrari with a nitrous-filled gas tank; 1850's prospectors who think Adil is in possession of rare ore because he's a smooth SILVER-tongued devil with a heart of GOLD; and mothers desperate for their daughters to date such a total class-act. Adil combines science and shrewd business sense, studying Economics and Chemistry while pursuing a healthcare certificate in order to eventually help save lives in the healthcare industry. He would also have a very successful career as a motivational speaker. Adil is indispensable as PJW's hype man and yell leader and is simultaneously the nerd, bad boy, class clown, and hot girl of PJW Academy.</p>

                            	<p>The legend of Milan Prema has been passed down from generations of man buns and still strikes a harmonious chord in the hearts “ladkis” everywhere. According to the tale of the salt-bae gujju, he has never been at a loss of words… like ever. His science acumen is so pristine, he lives vicariously through himself. His business card says “Myself Dr. Prema, Don’t Worry I’ll Call You.” He won the lifetime achievement award in somersaults... twice. He’s fluent in all languages, including a jusreign-gujarati fusion dialect which only he speaks. We could revel in his superiority all day, but in short, he’s the most interesting something-one-thing on the team.</p>                            	
                            	<a href="#"><img src="images/JobinM.jpg" style="width:300px;height:400px;"></a>	
                                <p>Behold, the perfect specimen. Well, perfect if being able to put your elbows together isn’t on your checklist. He’s a man larger than life itself. A man with a chest bigger than the state of Mississippi. A man that can bench press another man. But don’t be fooled by his chest of steel, guns blacklisted by airport security, and a mean mug that sends you crying to your momma. His smile, whiter than Ed Hunt, brightens up an entire room. His humor never fails to get a couple rofl-ers. And his giggle? It’s to die for. As a biochemistry student and future dentist with a straight path to every woman’s (and man’s) heart, Mr. Mathew’s natural charisma makes him a lovable teammate. This loyal Punjabbawockee makes an impact on the team that will be cherished for generations to come.</p>
