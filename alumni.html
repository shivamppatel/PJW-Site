                                <p><font size="3">“Make it SLIMEY.” Aaron Burroughs epitomizes what many would call “perfection.” There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it. Aaron is both. Why look up at ALL THE STARS (SZA) when Aaron’s luminescence is enough to brighten anyone's day? When he isn’t at 7/11 dancing to 7/11 by Queen B, Aaron is the sole reason why “What Starts Here Changes The World.” As Director of MenCanEnd and a Texas Blazer, Aaron embodies the selfless, amiable, and charismatic characteristics of the man your parents warned you about. In addition to his infinite accolades, Aaron is fluent in Arabic and truly exemplifies how to Baghdad booty up! I’ll let you in on a little secret: in order to attain instantaneous gratification and fulfillment in life, do yourself a favor and simply gaze at Aaron’s impeccable features and raw emotion as he rages on stage. Feel your knees begin to buckle beneath you, and allow yourself to succumb to the sensation that is inevitably going to supersede your greatest fantasy. Above all, Aaron is an amazing friend. His presence alone is enough to alleviate any worry in the world, and Punjabbawockeez is blessed to have him on the team. Even though Aaron plans to graduate this semester and embark upon a new journey, he is destined for greatness, and PJW wishes him the best in his future endeavors.</font></p>

One thing is for sure: you don’t mess with this man. Forget Harvey Specter, Stewart is the future lawyer that will make sure you don’t rise up from the ashes once he’s done making his argument against you. He is the one guy that steals the spotlight by wearing ripped jeans at a formal. As intimidating as he sounds, it turns out that this bad boy has a heart of gold. His insane dedication to Texas Blazers and service in general will without a doubt touch your heart. In fact, rumor has it that Corgis at Zilker actually come to him to be petted and receive his blessings. Ladies, if you are looking to find a man with god like charisma, we will be accepting applications at 1-800-YOU’LL-PROBS-BE-REJECTED.</font></p>

Women swoon at the mere whiff of his intoxicating essence, and men everywhere fall short of his machismo and sensual prowess. Rishabh Shah’s cleverness is paralleled only by the hypothetical technological singularity that may never exist. Powered by the indomitable will to achieve excellence, Rishabh Shah shatters the expectations of people who have unrealistic expectations. Rishabh Shah is a hardworking individual that is destined to continue achieving greatness. He brings a unique energy to the team, and never fails to make his teammates laugh with his inexplicable brand of humor. He is an invaluable asset to Punjabbawockeez, and we are extremely lucky to have him as a teammate and brother.</font></p>

Mister Sauve-amente uses his tattoos to intimidate those on the court, all while consuming the delicacies known as the pani pudi's. However, pushing basketball to the side and whenever he's not being a secret agent, Suhas is ready to perform Hip Hop anywhere, anytime. Only caveat is that his shoes will disintegrate due to the incogitable conformation this young protégé places upon his body's bearings. If that didn't make sense, then it's ok, because this pupil will be budding soon into Dr. Tatapudi with his extensive Honorary Biochemistry knowledge. And if that's not enough to lull you to sleep at night, then get ready for some Juju on That Beat ;). But wait, there's more! (But how?? He's already so perfect). Well let me tell you how. While striving for greatness in the many sectors of his life, Suhas is also part of an organization called Texas Blazers! Yes, indeed this does mean that he blazes through campus, but not the 420 style. Along the semantic lines of the Blazers, this younglin' goes above and beyond to help change social norms in attempts for equality. (That's a lot, there couldn't possibly be more). Oh but there is! Suhas Tatapudi builds up his J2 street cred by using his powers of being an RA. Once everything boils down, when there's trouble, this superhero will be there on the double!</font></p>

He was born with a rare ability bend his body in unimaginable ways and chances are if you ever talk to Gordon face to face, you'll actually be talking to his face and his foot side by side. Some even go as far as to call him the first real life Super-Saiyan. But that’s not all; this man is as intellectual as he is flexible. Contemplating a triple major in BHP, Engineering, and Math, the man can truly do it all. Based on his immense Facebook following, you probably already know him and if you think people can't fly, Gordon will show you otherwise.</font></p>

Adil combines science and shrewd business sense, studying Economics and Chemistry while pursuing a healthcare certificate in order to eventually help save lives in the healthcare industry. He would also have a very successful career as a motivational speaker. Adil is indispensable as PJW's hype man and yell leader and is simultaneously the nerd, bad boy, class clown, and hot girl of PJW Academy.</font></p>

It is said that sages and wise men across the world collectively felt his kicking in the womb, the beginnings of his divine dance. When he was born on the distant island of Mauritius, an energy swept across the globe, causing even the most hard-hearted of Wall Street analysts (of which he would eventually become a part) to convulse in joy. But young Ziyaad was destined for great things, he soon set out on his odyssey across the seas, and, after conquering nations as well as the hearts of many women, he settled down. He now hails from the Land of Sugar: a suburb of Houston, Texas, and the third best city in the U.S., according to a few arbitrary rankings in obscure publications. These days, Ziyaad attends a university (mostly to keep up appearances; he's learned everything he needs to about the world already in his epic voyages). You might find him giving a TED talk here and there. For real, go look up his TED talk now; it's glorious. People always ask: Ziyaad, do you try and make ladies of the court swoon as you walk by? In response, Ziyaad smiles effortlessly, and a lady somewhere feels their heart throb and their knees buckle.</font></p>

This embodiment of fun and good vibes isn’t all play – he’s also studying Business Honors and has finagled himself a consulting job at Sense Corp. When he’s not saving a corporation’s livelihood, you can find the Human Bentipede playing Skyrim as he slays hordes of dragons as the Dragonborn. Everyone else on the team looks up to him, both physically and in Bhangra. While starting the year as a newbie, he has quickly become a core part of Team Book Len Day.

In addition to all of this, Viraj is a Computer Science and Finance double major who will be working at Goldman Sachs this summer. How does Viraj power all of this awesomeness? One word. Qdoba. The fuel that powers this great man exists in the humble combination of rice, beans, chicken, queso, and guacamole. Our team see's the incredible power this mystical substance has on him. Like Popeye with spinach, Qdoba is the substance Viraj consumes before practice and performances. This elevates him to a superhuman level of dance that is observed in his god - like bhangra performances.</font></p>

                                <p><font size="3">Ed is the man your mother warned you about. Often referred to as the Godfather of suave, Ed is the synergistic creation of fatal attraction and intellectual prowess, sort of like Ron Weasley meets Wall Street. Ed managed to get 364 girls' phone numbers last year, which really pissed him off, because he was just shy of 1 girl a day. Serving as vice-chair of public relations in Texas Blazers, Ed puts the elation in public relation. His essence is the psychological triumph of grace over order. His body and soul were both meant to bleed burnt orange. His ferocious red mane entitled him to be king of the jungle. However, this beast has his own peculiar cuteness which is best described by Mark Twain himself: "While the rest of the species is descended from apes, redheads are descended from cats."</font></p>

Often mistaken as a bird or a plane, Shamis Khan minds not. In fact, the modest hero passed much of the credit on to his sidekick, Clark Kent, and realizing that anonymity was the greatest defense for his loved ones, Mr. Khan hung up his cape long ago, settling into the peaceful life of a Business/Pre-Med student at The University of Texas at Austin. Now and then, one hears legends of Shamis Khan—how hurricane season in his hometown of Galveston is really just his allergy season or how solar eclipses sometimes occur when Shamis hoops on the weekends. Alas, although his selfless service to the people of this wonderful planet has come to a close, one can see remnants of his forgotten life in the majestic hip-hop he unleashes onstage. And that is his true selfless service. Thank you, Mr. Khan, for continuing to show the people of this planet that there is still magic in the world.</font></p>

Reigning from Sugarland, Texas, it’s only fitting that this Punjabbawockee has some of the sweetest dance moves around. In fact, Arjun’s audition for the team included an unforgettable performance inspired by the moves of the very own MJ himself. Fedora and all, it’d be an understatement to say this “smooth criminal’s” dance was anything short of a “thriller”, and yes, “he rocked our world”. When Arjun isn’t busy charming everyone with his killer smile, contagious laugh, and sharp dressing, you’ll find him working towards getting a degree in Biomedical Engineering (not to mention he’s Pre-Med too…doctor AND engineer?!?! My goodness.), getting published with all his work in the University of Texas’ research labs, volunteering, or hooping it up at Gregory Gym. A genuine individual, an ideal teammate, a mesmerizing dancer, and as mentioned above, the deliverer of goods, Arjun has, without a doubt, been an incredible addition to the Punjabbawockeez.</font></p>

Luckily, with his doctoral credentials he'll sew that baby back up in less than a heartbeat. Whoever created this fine specimen of man spent a little bit more time on him than other humans. His flawless character and sculpted body is what every man, woman, and child seeks in life. Captivating women’s attention with the flick of his lasso (on him at all times), this cowboy is the man of any girl’s dreams. His beauty can be a curse at times; being constantly booked with dates to his favorite local coffee shops! When he’s not making the girls of the world swoon, Arj trades in his lasso for books as a pre-med, pre-law, Plan II Honors & Public Health dual degree at The University of Texas at Austin. He is also a Vice-President of Texas Student Media Board of Trustees, a Camp Texas Counselor, and an active leader in Tejas, the premiere men’s organization at The University of Texas at Austin. This is the guy that the aunties compare their sons to and always ask them, “why can’t you be more like Arj?” Arj is a genuine man and it’s amazing seeing this guy rage on stage. A little word of advice to the ladies out there: act now to have a chance with this amazing guy or you’ll have to settle for a guy who’s….well not Arj.</font></p>

Kunal is always willing to go out of his way to help a friend - be it for dance practice, to study for a test, play Nintendo 64, or just vent about life. Despite his unquestionable popularity and super rough exterior (lol), Kunal is a sentimental guy who genuinely cares about his friends. In reference to the Sanskrit definition, Kunal is the name of one of the Himalayan birds with beautiful eyes.

While he is an incredible dancer, has impeccable style, and a genuine smile that will make your clothes fall off, the real catch is the big heart under that strong exterior. The soft sensitive Allan loves long walks on the beach, and intimate conversations. The tough Allan loves benching 315 pounds. He's a beast in bed, on the court, on the dance floor, in the classroom, and quite literally everywhere else. He's the man you deserve, and definitely the one you need right now. So hunt him.

This hunk is a senior with a Business Honor major here at UT Austin and is well on his way to success at McKinsey & Company consulting firm in Dallas so hopefully he can hold his ground as a faithful Spurs fan in The Big D. In his spare time, David likes to work out to make sure he stays a lean, mean, loving machine and plays ball, hoping to be the next Tim Duncan, but looks more like Jeremy Lin. For any points he misses on the court, he makes up for by scoring with the ladies anywhere he goes. In fact, David likes to clean his feet after every practice because he wants to be that slick for the ladies. When he’s not dancing, balling, or chatting it up with the honeys, David participates in Texas Blazers and helps make the world a better place, one day at a time.</font></p>

The beats are in his bones, and there's no stopping him when he starts feeling the music. He practiced so hard after joining the team that his foot had to heal for a good three months, protected by a big, black, boot. But this didn't stop Chintan. Despite his injury, Chintan made sure to show us that even the stanky-leg can be bootylicious. Chintan wants to go to med school, but with a face like Matt Bomer's and a body like Ryan Gosling's, just one quick look at Dr. Gohel would probably solve all his patients' problems. His quick mind and his dashing looks make him a Longhorn version of Barney Stinson, but don't be fooled. Chintan is a hopeless romantic like Ted Mosby. With a knack for proposing to girls on the spot, Chintan has all the ladies lined up to be Mrs. Gohel. The two ways to win his heart are through dance and sarcasm, and this explains why we expect Chintan's next proposal to be to the team. Most of all, Chintan embodies the qualities of a true friend and teammate, and his passion makes him an inspiring addition to Punjabbawockeez.</font></p>

At an early age, Shakir realized he could sell his sweat to others as a drink called Muscle Milk. Whether it’s running long-distance relays of 200+ miles, outlifting everyone at the gym, or inventing new dance moves, Shakir can do it all. And his hair will always look perfect while he does it. In fact, the creator of P90X regularly calls Shakir for life advice. Don’t be fooled by his absent-mindedness, ladies. If Shakir can manage to keep his focus on you, you’re in for one unforgettable time. They don’t call him “Shocker” for no reason. When he’s not flirting or dancing, Shakir works hard toward his Kinesiology degree and his role as fitness coordinator for Texas 4000. Yes, that’s right, he even finds time to fight cancer. If you can’t find Shakir at Gregory Gym, he’s probably making smoothies for famous Austinites at Pure Austin Fitness, or figuring out what shoes go well with his tight pants.

He resides in lucid dreams so lucid that he can make your dreams a reality as seamlessly as Leonardo Di Caprio. Legend has it that Sahil is the second coming of the Greek hero Achilles. It remains the only logical explanation of why the back of his foot aches after each practice and why he dances Bhangra with an unbridled fiery energy so fierce, only Zeus and his entourage could contain him. Taking PJW and UT by storm from the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Sahil has convinced researchers that he is evolutionarily superior to the average man when it comes to the ladies because he learned how to extrapolate all the curves at a very early age.

His jumping prowess comes from his second job: baller, and I mean that in more ways than one. Get a basketball in this guy's hands, and you won't get it back. Find Shreyas at ACL, and girls will violently flock to him, to the point where he leaves nearly injured!

But don't feel left out. Shaan is such a kind heart that he wants the world to enjoy the facial perfection that he experiences daily. So he's currently working on a chin cream that will do just the trick. It’s called Patelixir of Chin. In stores this Christmas season. A famous Disney movie was actually based on Shaan's first novel, Chinderella. Don't worry, he gets royalties for it. He graces the dancefloor with ease and utter patelegance. He's one-upping Oprah by not only creating a new network, but a new viewing experience: Patelevision. He can command anything to dance without even touching it because he's Patelekinetic. He thinks it's cute when people give him awards, so instead he makes his own. Ever her of the Shaan Awards? 'Nuff said.

Shakira wrote "Hips Don't Lie" after she spent a wild night downtown with Abhijith. In a recent interview, she was quoted as saying, "He taught me everything I know." Abhijith's contribution to PJW and the world of dance has been so great that everyday P. Diddy wakes up feeling like him. From head to toe, Abhijith is the perfect mix of business and pleasure.</font></p>

                            	<p><font size="3">Shiv is a valuable gem on Punjabbawockeez, not only for his captivating Bhangra, but also for his rugged good looks, his American Dad jawline, and his million-dollar smile. We always knew we could use an exceptionally handsome and charming party animal among the second generation of PJW. Who knew Plan II and Government would turn girls on? When Shiv joined PJW, freshman girls would join ISA just because Shiv was Membership Coordinator, but it's Shiv's overflowing kindness that makes him unbeatably the most eligible bachelor at UT. Bringing that West Coast swag, Shiv is the coolest kid on the block. With his brains, looks, and Bhangra, Shiv is the total package.</font></p>
